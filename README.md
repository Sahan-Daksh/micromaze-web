# MicroMaze Website

Welcome to the MicroMaze website repository! This project showcases the Tailwind CSS configuration and design principles used to create an engaging and visually appealing website for the MicroMaze competition. Below is a comprehensive guide to understanding the MicroMaze event and the partnership opportunities available.

## Introduction

The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (IEEE RAS) is a professional society within IEEE, dedicated to advancing the fields of robotics and automation through knowledge exchange and hands-on experience. Established in 2023, the IEEE RAS at IIT focuses on fostering innovation and providing practical learning opportunities for undergraduates in the domain of robotics and automation.

## Our Vision and Mission

### Vision

Encourage enthusiastic innovators who will shape the future through their creative ideas and technological skills in robotics and automation.

### Mission

Guide innovators with a roadmap to turn their ideas into reality through mentorship, hands-on experience, and collaborative learning. We empower delegates to embark on a journey of creative and technological exploration in the fields of Robotics and Automation.

## Past Events

### IntroJam

An online session introducing students to robotics, providing insights through an interactive webinar.

### RobotNexus

An inter-university workshop series offering both theoretical and practical knowledge on robotics, consisting of online and physical sessions.

## What is MicroMaze?

MicroMaze is an inter-university competition designed to challenge participants to develop a micro mouse capable of solving a maze within a specified timeframe. This competition tests students' skills in robotics, programming, and problem-solving as they design robots to navigate through complex mazes efficiently. It provides a platform for undergraduates to apply their knowledge in a practical setting, fostering collaboration and learning.

## Event Structure

### Awareness Session

An initial session to introduce competition rules, evaluation criteria, and development guidelines. Participants will have approximately one month to develop their micromouse robots.

### Online Workshop

An online workshop sharing experiences and programming insights for micro-mouse competitions, followed by a Q&A session to address participant challenges.

### Qualifier Round

Competitors will face various rounds, including quarter-finals and semi-finals, narrowing down to the top 10 teams.

### Finale

The top 10 teams will compete in a complex maze to determine the final winners based on their robots' navigation and problem-solving capabilities.
